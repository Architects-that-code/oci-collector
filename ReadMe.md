So I am viewing this as a fun 'Batman’s utility belt' type of project. What are the common things that we keep sending to our accounts.
# Core blocking and tackling
- what are my limits
- Where am I running compute
- Who are all my users
- What are all my policies
- What regions am I subscribed to
- What compartments do i have
- where CAN I launch compute shape x
- what OS is supported by shape

# Support
- My open support tickets
- My open CAM tickets
- My open 'account' tickets
# What else do?
- Create support ticket?

- what if we add ability to CREATE CAM ticket for limits that are too 'low'?
- Run as instance principal
- Output data to files
- Send output as mail
- Publish as custom metrics


SHOULD the 'core' data (in config) be pushing into a library as almost everything else utilizes those data structures

## Should we refactor to use something like COBRA so adding additional tools is easier?

NOTE: 
if you are using INSTANCE PRINCIPAL you need to have the correct policies in place to allow the instance to read the data (dynamic group and policy etc)
